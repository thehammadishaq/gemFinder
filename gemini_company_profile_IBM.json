        "Description": "Information Technology (IT) Services, Software, and Hardware IBM's roots date back to the late 19th century, formally consolidating into the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) in 1911. It was renamed International Business Machines in 1924 to reflect its global ambitions. The company pioneered early computing technologies like punch-card machines and later became the dominant force in business computing with mainframe computers (e.g., the System/360 in the 1960s). It also played a critical role in developing the IBM Personal Computer in 1981, which set the standard for the nascent PC industry. In the 21st century, IBM shifted its core focus from commodity hardware and personal computers to higher-value services and software, notably with its pivot towards: Artificial Intelligence (AI), especially with the Watson platform. Hybrid Cloud Computing (significantly boosted by the acquisition of Red Hat). IBM's business is organized primarily around its focus on hybrid cloud and AI solutions for enterprises, delivered through five main segments: Software: Includes hybrid platform & solutions (Red Hat, AI/Machine Learning with watsonx, Security with QRadar), and Transaction Processing software. This is a primary growth engine. Examples: Red Hat OpenShift, IBM Cloud Paks, Watsonx (AI & data platform). Consulting: Offers business transformation and technology implementation services across areas like digital strategy, cloud migration, and AI adoption. AI strategy, Cloud Consulting, Application Services. Infrastructure: Focuses on high-performance enterprise systems, including mainframes and high-end servers. IBM Z (mainframe servers), IBM Power (servers), Storage Systems. Financing: Provides financing services for IBM systems, software, and services, as well as third-party equipment."
