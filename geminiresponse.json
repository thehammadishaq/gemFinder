    "When": {
      "FoundedYear": "2021",
      "FoundedDetails": "Founded as a development-stage company, which then merged with the Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) Good Works Acquisition Corp. to become publicly traded.",
      "IPODate": "The SPAC merger that made the company public occurred in 2021 (The specific date of the final de-SPAC transaction is often cited as August 27, 2021, though the first public trading under the CIFR ticker may vary slightly around that time).",
      "KeyMilestones": "Secured major data center sites in Texas (e.g., Odessa, Bear, Panther, Black Pearl, Colchis); Completed energization and full operation of key mining facilities (e.g., Black Pearl Phase I); Executed a transformative 10-year AI Hosting Agreement with Fluidstack and Google (approx. $3B contracted revenue); Executed a significant 15-year data center campus lease with Amazon Web Services (approx. $5.5B contracted revenue) to deliver 300 MW of capacity for AI workloads.",
      "Acquisitions": "Acquisitions or development agreements for key data center sites, such as the acquisition of Black Pearl Mining (late 2023) and securing majority ownership (~95%) in a joint venture to develop the 1-Gigawatt Colchis site in West Texas.",
      "RecentEvents": "The execution of major long-term HPC hosting contracts with Amazon Web Services and the development of the 1-Gigawatt Colchis site, signaling a significant strategic pivot and expansion into the high-performance computing data center sector."

    "How": {
      "BusinessModel": "A hybrid operational model focused on developing and operating industrial-scale data centers. The company allocates its power capacity between two main functions: self-mining Bitcoin and hosting High-Performance Computing (HPC) workloads for third-party clients (hyperscalers/AI companies).",
      "RevenueStreams": "1. **Self-Mining Revenue:** Bitcoin rewards earned from validating transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. 2. **HPC Hosting Revenue:** Lease payments and service fees from large-scale contracts with clients for providing turnkey data center space and power for AI/ML workloads. 3. **Ancillary Services Revenue:** Revenue generated from participating in power grid ancillary services (e.g., ERCOT) by adjusting power consumption.",
      "Products": "Bitcoin (as a mined commodity), Data Center Capacity and Power (as a service).",
      "Monetization": "Monetizes its owned/developed power and data center infrastructure by either dedicating it to its proprietary Bitcoin mining operations or leasing it out for long-term, high-value HPC hosting contracts. Bitcoin mined can be held on the balance sheet or sold for operational liquidity.",
      "CompetitiveAdvantages": "Strategic access to large-scale, low-cost, and flexible power capacity in Texas; Vertically integrated approach to data center construction and operation; Early strategic pivot into high-value, long-term HPC hosting for Tier 1 hyperscalers (like AWS and Google), providing revenue diversification and stability; Experienced management team from finance, technology, and energy sectors.",
      "MarketStrategy": "Focus on securing and developing a large pipeline of power capacity (e.g., the 3.2 GW pipeline) in energy-rich, non-traditional locations in Texas; Optimize capital allocation between self-mining Bitcoin and high-margin, contracted HPC hosting; Continuous focus on operational efficiency and a low all-in electricity cost per Bitcoin mined."
